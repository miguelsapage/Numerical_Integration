# Numerical Integration

## Composite middle-point (pmc.m)
This script outputs a table with the numeric integration of the probability density function when z is contained in [0; 3.4] and h = 0.01.

## Error (erro.m)
This script show a graphic with the error for different sub intervals of the integration from 0 to b (chosen by the user).

## Complementary Function (complementar.m)
Complementary function given by F(-z) = 1 - F(z). Table when z is contained in [3; 7.9].
